## We are a growing region

## The Region is still growing despite a Global Pandemic

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Between April 1st, `r max.year-1` and April 1st, `r max.year`, the Puget Sound Region grew by approximately `r format(region.pop.change, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` people. Approximately `r region.pop.change.migration`% of the growth in population in `r max.year` was from people migrating to the region.

- In `r region.pop.change.max.year`, the region added approximately `r format(region.pop.change.max, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` people, one of the fastest growing years ever. In that year, approximately `r region.pop.change.max.migration`% of the growth was from people migrating to the region.

- Regional population growth in `r max.year` returned to levels last experinced in `r region.pop.change.similar.year`

## County Population Growth

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Between 2015 and `r max.year`, King County has grown by `r format(king.delta, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` people, a `r king.delta.percent`% increase. This growth accounts for approximately `r king.shr`% of the total population growth for the region.

- Between 2015 and `r max.year`, Pierce County has grown by `r format(pierce.delta, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` people, a `r pierce.delta.percent`% increase.

- Between 2015 and `r max.year`, Snohomish County has grown by `r format(snohomish.delta, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` people, a `r snohomish.delta.percent`% increase.

## Population Growth in our Major Cities

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Between 2015 and `r max.year`, the City of Seattle has grown by `r format(seattle.delta, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` people. This growth accounts for approximately `r seattle.shr`% of the population growth for King County.

- Population growth in Pierce (`r format(pierce.delta, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")`) and Snohomish (`r format(snohomish.delta, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")`) counties were all less than the population growth for the City of Seattle.

- The cities of Bellevue, Redmond and Seattle have accounted for approximately `r brs.shr`% of the population growth for King County since 2015.

## Housing Production has been increasing steadily

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Between April 1st, `r max.year-1` and April 1st, `r max.year`, the Puget Sound Region added approximately `r format(hu.2021.sy, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` new housing units. Of these new units, approximately `r mf.shr.sy`% were multi-family.

- Multi-family housing unit construction has accounted for approximately `r mf.shr.my`% of all new housing unit production since 2015.

## County Housing Unit Growth

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

- Between 2015 and `r max.year`, King County has added `r format(round(king.hu.delta,-2), nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` housing units, a `r king.hu.delta.percent`% increase. This growth accounts for approximately `r king.hu.shr`% of the total housing unit production for the region.

- Between 2015 and `r max.year`, Pierce County has added `r format(round(pierce.hu.delta,-2), nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` housing units, a `r pierce.hu.delta.percent`% increase.

- Between 2015 and `r max.year`, the City of Seattle has added `r format(round(seattle.hu.delta,-2), nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` housing units. This growth accounts for approximately `r seattle.hu.shr`% of the housing unit growth for King County.

- Housing unit growth in Pierce (`r format(round(pierce.hu.delta,-2), nsmall=0, big.mark=",")`) and Snohomish (`r format(round(snohomish.hu.delta,-2), nsmall=0, big.mark=",")`) counties were all less than the housing unit change for the City of Seattle.

- The cities of Bellevue, Redmond and Seattle have accounted for approximately `r brs.hu.shr`% of the housing growth for King County since 2015.

## Median Home Sales Price

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

- By the end of August, the median home sales price in the Seattle MSA exceeded $730,0000

- Median prices have been increasing at a faster rate during the pandemic and have reached all time highs in the region.

## Median Monthly Rent

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

## Job recovery is on-going

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- `r region.jobs.lowest.mo.2020` of 2020 was the height of the pandemic job losses and regional employment had dropped to `r format(round(region.jobs.lowest.2020,-3), nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` jobs. This level of regional employment was last seen in the region in `r month(ymd(region.jobs.change.similar.date),label=TRUE, abbr=FALSE)` of `r year(ymd(region.jobs.change.similar.date))`.

- In `r latest.jobs.month` of `r max.year`, total regional employment was `r format(round(region.jobs.latest.mo.2021,-3), nsmall=0, big.mark=",")`. This compares to `r format(round(region.jobs.latest.mo.2019,-3), nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` in `r latest.jobs.month` of 2019, a `r 100-region.jobs.latest.mo.ratio.2021`% reduction from pre-pandemic levels. This level of regional employment was last seen in the region in `r month(ymd(region.jobs.change.similar.date.2021),label=TRUE, abbr=FALSE)` of `r year(ymd(region.jobs.change.similar.date.2021))`.

- Job trends in the Puget Sound Region mirror those of the entire state and the region continues to account for approximately `r region.state.jobs.latest.mo.ratio.2021`% of total employment in Washington State.

## Not all industries were impacted similarly by the Pandemic 
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Manufacturing jobs - especially aerospace - have been hard hit by pandemic reductions in travel. In `r latest.jobs.month` of `r max.year`, regional manufacturing related jobs were down `r format(manufacturing.delta, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` jobs (`r manufacturing.delta.percent`%) from 2019 levels.

- The leisure and hospitality suffered the greatest overall reductions in jobs in 2020 - losing approximately `r format(leisure.delta.2020, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` jobs in 2020 at the height of the pandemic. Although job growth has returned in 2021, the leisure and hospitality sector is still approximately `r format(leisure.delta.2021, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` jobs below 2019 levels (`r leisure.delta.percent`%).

## Initial Unemployment Claims: Gender & Race
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

Initial unemployment claims are any claims that are initiated for benefits by a worker. If the same worker files an initial claim, returns to work and is laid off again and re-applies for benefits a second time, this would count as two initial unemployment claims. 

- The share of initial unemployment claims for African Americans and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders are higher than any other race or ethnicity.

- Rates of unemployment claims by gender are similar over the pandemic.

## Initial Unemployment Claims: Age & Educational Attainment
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

Initial unemployment claims are any claims that are initiated for benefits by a worker. If the same worker files an initial claim, returns to work and is laid off again and re-applies for benefits a second time, this would count as two initial unemployment claims. 

- A higher share of workers without a 4-yr college degree have filed for initial unemployment claims.

- The youngest workers have experienced some of the highest shares of unemployment.

## SeaTac Airport

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}

- Approximately `r format(latest.seatac.screenings.2021, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` passengers per day were screened at SeaTac airport during the week of `r paste0(latest.seatac.month," ",latest.seatac.day,"th")`, 2021. This was up from approximately `r format(latest.seatac.screenings.2020, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` daily passenger screenings in 2020 but still approximately `r latest.seatac.screenings.ratio`% below the average for the same week of 2019.

- The lowest passenger screenings during the pandemic occurred the week of `r paste0(minimum.seatac.month," ",minimum.seatac.day,"th")`, 2020 when approximately `r format(minimum.seatac.screenings, nsmall=0, big.mark=",")` daily passengers were screened at the airport.

- Since late winter 2021, the seasonal variations for airport passengers have mirrored previous trends.
